		<!-- The HTTP Content-Security-Policy (CSP) upgrade-insecure-requests directive instructs user agents to treat all of a site's insecure URLs (those served over HTTP) as though they have been replaced with secure URLs (those served over HTTPS). This directive is intended for websites with large numbers of insecure legacy URLs that need to be rewritten. -->

		<!-- Note: The upgrade-insecure-requests directive is evaluated before block-all-mixed-content and if it is set, the latter is effectively a no-op. It is recommended to set either directive, but not both, unless you want to force HTTPS on older browsers that do not force it after a redirect to HTTP. -->
